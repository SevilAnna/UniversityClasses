#   EMÃœ 112 - Homework #2: COVID'19 Spread
#
#                                       SUMMARY
#   a)  On which day will more than half the population be infected (= Day Z) ?
#       - 1 person gets infected on day 1.
#       - Each infection lasts between 14-28 days (w. equal prob) & the person is infectious,
#           but after that period ends, they're no longer infectious & are also immune.
#       - Each person interacts w. a random number of others (between 0-10, w. equal prob)
#           every day (each person randomly selected, w. equal prob).
#       - The prob of infecting another person is 5%.
#
#   b)  Calculate how many ppl will be infected on Day Z.
#       Social distancing begins on day 20. Prob of one person interacting with n number of ppl:
#
#           n interactions:     0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |  10
#           probabilities:     50% | 25% | 10% |  5% |  3% |  2% |  1% |  1% |  1% |  1% |  1%
